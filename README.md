# typehero-aot-2023
My solutions for [Advent of TypeScript 2023](https://typehero.dev/aot-2023) challenge. I am a newbie in typescript. My solutions are simple and easy to understand them also they were made from one shot and I didn't improve them as my skills grew.

Special thanks to the organizers, I really enjoyed this challenge!
